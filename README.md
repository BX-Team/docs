## Getting Started

How to get docs running on your local machine for development.

### Prerequisites

-   [node](https://nodejs.org)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository. If you plan to make changes, create a fork first!

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/BX-Team/docs
```

2. Install all required dependencies.

```bash
$ npm install
```

3. Start the development server.

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server and open a browser window. The majority of changes will
be instantly reflected live without the need to restart the development server or reload the page in
your browser. Edit away!

### Building

```bash
$ npm run build
```

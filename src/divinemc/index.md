## üì¶ Building and setting up
### Initial setup
First, clone this repository (do not download it) and the run the following command in the root directory:
```bash
./gradlew applyPatches
```
After that, project is ready to use and editing it.

### Creating a patch
Patches are effectively just commits in either `DivineMC-API` or `DivineMC-Server`. To create one, just add a commit to either repo and run `./gradlew rebuildPatches`, and a patch will be placed in the patches folder. Modifying commits will also modify its corresponding patch file.

Read our [documentation](https://docs.bx-team.space/divinemc/dev/contributing) to learn more about patches

### Compiling
Use the command `./gradlew build` to build the API and server. Compiled JARs will be placed under `DivineMC-API/build/libs` and `DivineMC-Server/build/libs`. **These JARs are not used to start a server**.

To compile a server-ready paperclip jar, run `./gradlew createMojmapPaperclipJar`. The compiled paperclip jar will be in `build/libs/` in the main root.
